This is a loop:
<ul>
[for x := range a_list_of_maps.([]int)]
	[y := 500]
	[if something == 0]
		<li id="`x[1] + y`">\[`x[0].some_attr`\]</li>
	[endif]
	[if something == x]
		`fmt.Sprintf("a")`
	[else if something == y]
		b
	[else]
		c
	[endif]
[endfor]
</ul>
[include "included.html"]
[endblock]
there is no life outside of the block in a template
that extends another template
